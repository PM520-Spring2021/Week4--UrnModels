# Week4--UrnModels
This repository contains the pseudocode for simulation of Urn models

Here are the results I got from my code for Urn Task 5, where the weight of the black ball varies.

Expected # colors as a function of weight of black ball:

Weight= 1 Mean number of colors in urn at end: 3.997
Weight= 2 Mean number of colors in urn at end: 6.4264
Weight= 3 Mean number of colors in urn at end: 8.4478
Weight= 4 Mean number of colors in urn at end: 10.2922
Weight= 5 Mean number of colors in urn at end: 11.8176

Zeyun got essentially the same results, so I am guessing these are correct, but more confirmation would be welcome.
